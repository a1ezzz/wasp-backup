TODO: 0. Write Code!
TODO: 1. Make backup thread interactive and handle errors and make it stoppable
TODO: 2. Create one tar file that joins archive and meta instead of separate files
TODO: 3. Make target file "splittable", so one backup may be split into several chunks
TODO: 4. Create some scripts to decrypt/verify/... backup files
TODO: 5. Think of creating differential backup which finds files by modification/change time and or by hash comparision
